libviska-java: XMPP Library in Java 8 with Modern Features
==========================================================

libviska-java is an XMPP library written in Java 8. libviska-java aims to
support as many modern or experimental features as possible. It distincts with
other counterparts with the following reasons:

* Supports VoIP calls using XMPP Jingle standards.
* Rapidly drop any functions or standards that we consider them out of fashion
  or outdated. We believe this can accelrate the evolution of XMPP standards.
* Uses JAXB to parse XMPP queries.

## License

libviska-java is free software but we haven't chosen any open source licenses at
the time.

## Contributing

The devteam behind the Viska project is relatively small compared to its
proprietary counterparts who are backed by large companies. Therefore, we
welcome all kinds of help!
