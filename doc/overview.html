    <p>API Reference for Viska XMPP framework.</p>
    <p>
      There are various {@literal enum}s like
      {@link chat.viska.xmpp.StreamErrorException.Condition} that directly
      matches names defined in standards or specifications. No documentations
      for them is provided in this Javadoc since more detailed explanations are
      always available in the documents that define them. This also eliminates
      potential copyright problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most method parameters and method return types are annotated with a
      {@literal @}{@link io.reactivex.annotations.Nullable} or
      {@literal @}{@link io.reactivex.annotations.NonNull}. If a
      {@literal null} is passed to a {@link io.reactivex.annotations.NonNull}
      parameter, a {@link java.lang.NullPointerException} (or
      {@link java.lang.IllegalArgumentException} if specified explicitly) is
      guaranteed to be thrown. Although the annotations are not inherited, the
      semantic is.
