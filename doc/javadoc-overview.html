      The API Reference for Viska XMPP framework. This section contains general documentation
      targeting components of all packages and modules.

    <p>
      There are various {@literal enum}s like
      {@link chat.viska.xmpp.StreamErrorException.Condition} that directly
      matches names defined in standards or specifications. No documentations
      for them is provided in this Javadoc since more detailed explanations are
      always available in the documents that define them. This also eliminates
      potential copyright problems.
